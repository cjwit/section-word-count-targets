# Section Word Count Targets

This VSCode extension searches markdown headers for trailing text that includes `(Target: NNN)`. It displays the word count of the section calculated as percent progress against the given target.

## Requirements

This is an adaptation of the [word count extension example](https://vscode.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/example-word-count/).
